# UI Genetic Algorithm & Tabu Search

This project represents the second assignment for the course Artifical Intelligence. This project was written entirely in the Python programming language. There are 2 types of algorithms, the Genetic algorithm and Tabu Search.

The Genetic Algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. 
Tabu Search is an iterative neighborhood search algorithm, where the neighborhood changes dynamically. Tabu search enhances local search by avoiding points in the search space which are already visited. By avoiding already visited points, loops in search space are avoided and local optima can be escaped.

This project was completed on 9.11.2022.
